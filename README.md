# Attack on Deathrock Castle

Attack on Deathrock Castle is an jRPG game where you must defeat the evil necromancer that threatens your home village among others. You settle on with a few volunteers (though, with no battle experience) to defeat this monester. However, on their trip, their ship explodes and you wake up on the Deathrock Castle alone. 
Find your companions and defeat the evil necromancer that threatens your village!
